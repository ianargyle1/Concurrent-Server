# Concurrent-Server

This code impliments the requirements from assignment 6 of CS 4400 (Computer Systems) of the University of Utah. The purpose of this assignment is to modify a web server to implement a concurrent friend-list server.  Part of the serverâ€™s functionality involves acting as a client to introduce friends from other servers that implement the same protocol. My code is in friendlist.c, the rest was provided to me from the University of Utah.
